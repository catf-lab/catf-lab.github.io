        Established in 2014, we are a group of cryptography researchers from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Our research focuses are symmetric-key cryptology and privacy-preserving technologies. We are physically hosted by the [Division of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics) of the [School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms), have been part of [Temasek Laboratories @ NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/temasek-labs) and [Coding and Cryptography Research Group](http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~ccrg/), and in collaboration with [Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

        We are **constantly** looking for [PhD candidates](https://guo.crypto.sg/students) and Post-Doctoral Research Fellows, and maintain a regular visitor/exchange program, if you are interested in any of them, please contact [Jian Guo](https://guo.crypto.sg/).

        We are grateful to our funders and sponsors:
