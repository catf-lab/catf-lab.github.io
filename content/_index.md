        Established in 2014, we are a group of cryptography researchers from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Our research focuses are symmetric-key cryptology and privacy-preserving technologies. We are physically hosted by the [Division of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics) of the [School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms), have been part of [Temasek Laboratories @ NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/temasek-labs) and [Coding and Cryptography Research Group](http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~ccrg/), and in collaboration with [Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

        We are **constantly** looking for [PhD candidates](https://guo.crypto.sg/students) and Post-Doctoral Research Fellows, and maintain a regular visitor/exchange program, if you are interested in any of them, please contact [Jian Guo](https://guo.crypto.sg/).

        We are grateful to our funders and sponsors:

        2022/12: Together with Assoc Prof Pinaki Sengupta, our research proposal on "Complexity Analysis For Designing Efficient Quantum Algorithms" won the SPMS Collaborative Research Award 2022.

        2022/12: Jian Guo was invited to talk at [Asiacrypt 2022](https://asiacrypt.iacr.org/2022/) on "Evolution of Cryptanalysis: Security Status of SHA-3 and AES Hashing".

        2022/11: Joint with J. Guo, L. Song, and H. Wang, the paper entitled "Improved Related-Key Boomerang Attack against the Full AES-256" won the Best Paper Award of [ACISP 2022](https://uow-ic2.github.io/acisp2022/program.html).
